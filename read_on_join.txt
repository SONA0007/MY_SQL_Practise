The said SQL query that uses the NATURAL JOIN clause to combine rows from three tables: orders, customer, and salesman.

The NATURAL JOIN clause compares all columns of the two joined tables and only returns the rows where the values match.

The query retrieves all columns from the three tables where the customer_id from the orders table matches the customer_id 
from the customer table, and the salesman_id from the orders table matches the salesman_id from the salesman table.

Note that using NATURAL JOIN can be dangerous if the tables have columns with the same name but different meanings, because it could lead to unexpected results.
