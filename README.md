This repository, "MY_SQL_Practise", is a collection of SQL queries and scripts that cover various aspects of SQL, including aggregate functions, subqueries, joins, and basic SQL operations. The project aims to provide a comprehensive set of resources for practicing and mastering SQL skills, which can be useful for coding interviews.

## Main Function Points
- Provides a collection of SQL scripts covering different SQL concepts and operations
- Includes scripts for practicing aggregate functions, subqueries, joins, and basic SQL operations
- Serves as a resource for individuals preparing for coding interviews or improving their SQL skills

## The main SQL concepts covered in the "MY_SQL_Practise" repository include:

1. Aggregate Functions: Techniques for performing calculations on a set of values to return a single value (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT).

2. Subqueries: Queries nested within another query, allowing for more complex data retrieval.

3. Joins: Methods for combining rows from two or more tables based on related columns (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN).

4. Basic SQL Operations: Fundamental SQL commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

5. Filtering and Sorting Data: Using WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY clauses to refine and organize query results.

These concepts are essential for mastering SQL and preparing for coding interviews.
